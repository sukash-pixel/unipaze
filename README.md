# 🎓 Unipaze – Smarter Education Loan Discovery

> **Unipaze** is a one-stop platform that helps students find and compare education loans based on their college. Just type your college name and instantly view banks offering tailored loan options.

## 🧠 Why We Built Unipaze

As a student seeking admission, I personally faced difficulties in finding reliable information about education loans. I was unaware that my own college had existing tie-ups with banks offering specialized student loans.

Many colleges today, especially private institutions, can cost ₹5 lakhs per year or even more — and students often miss out on tailored loan options due to lack of centralized info.

This inspired us to build **Unipaze** — a platform that simplifies the search for education loans by letting students:
- 🔍 Enter their college name
- 🏦 Instantly view all tied-up banks
- 📋 Compare loan terms, eligibility, collateral requirements, and nearby branches

## 🚀 Features

- Search for any college
- View all banks partnered with that college
- See loan details (type, interest, max amount, tenure, documents)
- Compare all banks side by side
- Get info on the nearest branch
